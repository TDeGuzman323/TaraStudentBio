<h2>STUDENT BIO</h2>
<h3> Tara DeGuzman</h3>

<p> Hello! My name is Tara DeGuzman. I have been a singer since I was 7 Years old. I grew up in LA but lived in New York for about four years.
    I moved to New York to pursue my dreams of being on the Broadway stage. After a lot of auditioning, I managed to score my first big audition for "Wicked."
    I was eventually cast as the second understudy for the lead role of Elphaba. While I was pursuing my acting career in New York, I also ran underground Poker Games.
    It was really fun, dangerous, and got to meet some really cool people - some, I'm still friends with today.
</p>

<p> I moved back to LA in 2013. Since then, I've held various jobs holding some fairly high level positions. I've been the Executive Assistant to CEO's of various Fortune 500 companies. 
    I have been an Executive Assistant to the CEO of a well known talent agency and from there was promoted to "Comedy Agent." Now I work in hospitality with a focus on property management and guest services.
    I am looking forward to new beginnings with this coding program and hopefully forge my own path. One day, I'd like to be the CEO that guides a young aspiring woman like I was into their 
    future. 
</p>
